## Getting started

Chiya is deployed into a production environment using [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/) images. As such, the install guide will focus on deployment via Docker. Chiya has been tested on both Windows and Linux bare metal environments and attempts to retain compatibility across both operating systems but this may not always be the case. The install guide assumes that you already have Docker and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed.

You will also need a Discord bot with [privileged intents](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intents.html) enabled and the token for that bot before installation. You can create a new Discord bot [here](https://discord.com/developers/). Keep in mind Chiya will need the `bot` and `applications.commands` scopes selected when you generate your OAuth2 URL to function properly. If you intend on using the Reddit functionality, you will also need to create a Reddit application [here](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/).

## Install

**Step 1:** Download the `docker-compose.yml` to your local file system with `curl`, `wget`, etc. like so:
```
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ranimepiracy/chiya/master/docker-compose.yml
```

**Step 2:** Create a `.env` file in the same folder as you saved your `docker-compose.yml` and fill out the following:

```env
# The Discord bot token from https://discordapp.com/developers/
BOT_TOKEN=

# The prefix for the bot to use. 
# Not all commands are ported to slash commands due to some limitations.
BOT_PREFIX=

# The level at which logs should be outputted to console.
# NOTSET, TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, or CRITICAL
LOG_LEVEL=

# The folder where you plan to store your database files (on the host OS)
DATABASE_FOLDER=

# The folder where you plan to store your bot logs (on the host OS)
LOGS_FOLDER=

# Set two unique secure passwords for your MySQL users
MYSQL_PASSWORD=
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=

# Your Reddit bot information from https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/
REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=
REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=

# Your Reddit bot user agent, see: https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/wiki/API#rules
REDDIT_USER_AGENT=
```

**Step 3:** Pull the Docker image by executing `docker-compose pull` in the same folder as the `docker-compose.yml`

**Step 4:** Start Chiya by executing `docker container start chiya_bot_1`
